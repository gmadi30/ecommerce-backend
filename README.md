# E-Commerce Backend System

I've created this project to practice the following: 
* Dependency Injection with frameworks like Spring Boot.
* Following SOLID Principles in designing your services and classes.
* Building REST APIs and exposing endpoints for products, orders, payments, and customers.
* Deploying Microservices on AWS using Elastic Beanstalk or EC2.

1. Core Features:
    * Product Catalog Service: CRUD operations for products.
    * Order Service: Place and track orders.
    * Payment Service: Simulate payments and statuses.
    * Customer Management Service: Handle customer details and authentication.
    * Database: MySQL.

2. Tech Stack:
    * Java + Spring Boot
    * Spring Data JPA for database access
    * Microservices using Spring Cloud
    * Docker (to containerize services)
    * AWS: Deploy with Elastic Beanstalk or containerized using ECS
